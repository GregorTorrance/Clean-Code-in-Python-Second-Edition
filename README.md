# Clean code in Python 

The Python language is immensely prevalent in numerous areas, such as software construction, systems administration, and data processing. Experienced professionals in every field face the challenges of disorganization, poor readability, and low testability as a result of unstructured code.

With updated code and revised content aligned to the new features of ``Python 3.9``, this second edition of ***Clean Code in Python*** will provide you with all the tools you need to overcome these obstacles and manage your projects successfully.

The book begins by describing the basic elements of writing clean code and how it plays a key role in Python programming. You will learn about writing efficient and readable code using the Python standard library and best practices for software design.

The book delves deeply into object-oriented programming in Python and shows you how to use objects with ``descriptors`` and ``generators``. It will also show you the design principles of software testing and how to resolve problems by implementing software design patterns in your code. In the final chapter, we break down a monolithic application into a microservices based one starting from the code as the basis for a solid platform.

By the end of this clean code book, you will be proficient in applying industry-approved coding practices to design clean, sustainable, and readable real-world Python code.
